2 ways to find distance (both find the solution in different ways, fundamentally the same though)

Elizabeth's idea: 
Place camera at set distance & known angle to gear peg, take picture
Find ratio of longer:shorter side (the closer to 1:1 it is, the closer it is to 90 deg.)
Angle += 10, repeat

Gordon's idea:
Place camera at set distance & known angle to gear peg, take picture
Find center of fov & centroid (center of mass) of trapezoid and compare for each distance

Both methods assume the camera's stays at a constant distance from gear peg (no offset)
This doesn't mean anything though because moving to the side doesn't change the angle the camera's at, so it shouldn't change the solution we get

We need to try both methods, but we should probably find which one works better....
Elizabeth's idea is easy to find a lot of data points for, but Gordon's idea is faster to compute and more accurate overall
