Install python 3.5, 32 bit (or whatever version) for all users - root (check all boxes) https://www.python.org/downloads/

To check if it worked, just enter python in terminal 

Download the Numpy whl file from http://www.lfd.tlyuci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy using version that corresponds w/ python version 
Downlad the OpenCV whl file from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ using package that matches the Python and Numpy version

Open terminal and enter this command to install Numpy: pip install "[version of numpy you downloaded]"

Enter this command to install OpenCV: pip install “[version of opencv you downloaded]

Make sure it says “successfully installed _________” after each command

Add opencv to your path by either making a new environment variable...
Name of variable = OPENCV_DIR, value = directory to opencv, eg, downloads\opencv\Build\x64\vc14 if opencv’s in downloads

Or you can make a batch file...
Find the vc14 folder in OpenCV then make a txt file:
For Windows:
SET OPENCV_HOME=C:\opencv\build\x64\vc14
SET PATH=%PATH%;%OPENCV_HOME%\bin

For Linux:
SET OPENCV_HOME=C:\opencv\build\x64\vc14
SET PATH=$PATH;$OPENCV_HOME\bin

To check if the download worked open the Python shell and write:
import cv2

If that returns nothing then try this:
print(cv2.__version__)

If that returns the OpenCV version, you're good
If either line throws an error, there's a problem
